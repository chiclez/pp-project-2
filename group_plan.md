# Project 2 - Group plan

In your first meeting, discuss and record a quick note of your agreed answers to the following questions:

- When and how often will you meet as a group? Will you use Zoom, Teams, something else?
Teams meetings

- How will you communicate outside of your meetings (email, Teams, Discord, group chat...)?
Teams group chat

- Is everyone comfortable with using git/GitHub? If not, one person could demonstrate for the group during your first meeting; if nobody is comfortable, ask on Piazza or email Charlotte!
All of us are Okay with git

- Discuss your ideas for questions to investigate. Are there questions in the suggestions which you find interesting? Do you have new ideas of your own? You can keep a note of these ideas here.

Here are some ideas to get our feet wet:

1. the number of different roads managed different local authorities
2. the longest road (have the most number of different counting points)
3. the 5 busiest roads on average over the past 20 years for total number of vehicles /for different types of vehicles
4. the most likely time of the day to find a bicycle on a C-road? What are the most likely weeks of the year to find a bicycle anywhere

Then we will decide what we want to investigate further. We will meet again on Wednesday.

next step for group1:
1.figure out the number of bicycles used by different authorities and which authority uses bicycles most often.
2.do some visualisations: use a heat map or other charts to indicate the number of bicycles used in each authority.

next step for group 2:
1. Find a pattern between the traffic and its proximity to a popular spot (i.e. markets, schools, hospitals)
2. Present the results using plots and maps

- How do you want to divide the tasks? Are you planning to pair-program?
Pair programming in groups of 2. 
Group 1: Julia and Zhiwen
Group 2: Shuxiao and Mariel ("LingHui")

- Who will put together, proofread, and push the final notebook before the deadline? Will one person be responsible, will you have a final meeting together, or something else?

"Best practice for a good repository health"
- Pull when we start working on the notebook. Ensure that we have the latest version. Then, commit the change.

- Put together the work as a team

- Proofread and bug "detection" will be done as needed. When one group finishes an analysis/function, the other group can look at it and "discover" bugs that were not seen by the "developer".

- Code review every week, during the weekend. Mariel will do this.
